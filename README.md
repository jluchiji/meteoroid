# Meteoroid
**Meteoroid:** bigger than a dust but smaller than an asteroid.
[Meteor][1] flavored [Atom Shell][2]. Or [Atom Shell][2] flavored [Meteor][1].

This project attempts to produce a cross between [meteor][1] and [atom-shell][2]. Wouldn't be full stack reactivity awesome for building desktop applications? I think so.

## Directory Structure
 - `app`: Boilerplate app for testing purposes
 - `build`: Gruntfile and build scripts
 - `src`: Meteoroid-specific scripts
 - `packages`: Meteor packages
